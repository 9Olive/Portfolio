            <p>

                I am a currently a Masters student at North Carolina State University studying Statistics with a focus
                on
                data science and machine learning applications.
                Prior to NCSU I studied at Barton College, and graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's of Science in
                Chemistry
                and Mathematics.
                For the past three years I explored the chemistry side of my degree as an Analytical Chemist.
                With my lab coat dawned, I had formal training in a <abbr title="current Good Manufacturing Practices">cGMP</abbr>
                environment to execute and develop test methods for research compounds, clinical phase trials, and
                commercial drug products.
                Due to the pace and volume at which data moves, I felt compelled to incorporate my mathematical
                training as
                well.
                I have since taken a keen interest in the challenges and techniques used to manipulate big data to
                extract
                meaningful conclusions.
